## Overview

Service-Picker is a simple library for creating a new full stack project and deploy it in aws by just doing some cli stuffs. We are using `picky` as our CLI tool.

Keep the repos you're interested in and you're good to go.

`picky` works on macOS, Windows and Linux.<br>

## Future Plans

As of now, we can build full stack project which consist of the backend `Node JS` and the frontend `React JS` or `Next JS`. We don't have mobile application support. So We are planned to add support for mobile applications, currently we are working on it. And we have only `AWS` support now. Also we will add support of different cloud providers such as `GCP` and `Azure` and other stacks.
